 static const char *__doc_gr_dsd_dsd_block_ff = R"doc(<+description of block+>

Constructor Specific Documentation:

Return a shared_ptr to a new instance of dsd::dsd_block_ff.

To avoid accidental use of raw pointers, dsd::dsd_block_ff's constructor is in a private implementation class. dsd::dsd_block_ff::make is the public interface for creating new instances.

Args:
    frame : 
    mod : 
    uvquality : 
    errorbars : 
    verbosity : )doc";
